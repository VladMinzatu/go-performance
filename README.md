This is a collection of benchmarks and test scripts that I am writing as I get more intimate with the Go runtime and the performance and optimization considerations of writing Go code.

TODO: projects structure - bla bla, tests are in src/... etc.

The code is written by me and the experiments are also run by myself. However, I am learning about these different optimizations and pitfalls from books and other resources, of course. Where applicable, I will point out where I learned about what I am demonstrating in its corresponding subdirectory.
